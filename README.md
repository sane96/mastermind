# Mastermind
This project is part of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind">The Odin Project's</a> Ruby curriculum.

# Game Description
There are many variations of Mastermind, according to Wikipedia, so I choose to use the original game rules. There are 6 different colors that form a 4 color "code" that another player tries to break in 12 guesses. After each guess, they receive feedback on the number of pegs that were the right color or if that right color was also in the correct spot.

# Testing 
Used Rspec for unit testing correct and incorrect spelling
